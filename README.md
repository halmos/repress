Repress is a tiny library which takes control of part of your Redux state and handles talking to the WordPress REST API. Repress only owns a piece of your Redux state (called the **substate**), allowing you to incrementally add it to existing projects and remain in control of your store.

Repress requires Redux and [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk).

Keep reading for a simple introduction, or dive into [the documentation](docs/README.md).


## Installation

Repress is [available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@humanmade/repress), simply add it to your project to get started:

```sh
npm install --save @humanmade/repress

# Or, if you're using Yarn
yarn add @humanmade/repress
```

You'll then need to [connect it to your store](docs/start.md).


## The Basics

This library is a reusable tool that you can gradually add to your codebase. You simply create "handlers" for every top-level object (posts or CPTs, comments, terms, and users) you'd like to keep in your Redux store, and the handler takes care of dispatching.

The handler "owns" a piece of your global Redux state called the **substate**, and handles dispatching and reducing any actions related to it. You can keep the substate wherever you want in your Redux store, allowing you to incrementally adopt the library.

Setting up a handler is a three-step process:

1. Instantiate a handler with options for the type
2. Add the reducer to the store
3. Create actions and helpers using the handler's methods


### A Simple Example

Typically, you'll want to have a single `types.js` file containing the setup for all your types. You can then use in your regular `actions.js` and `reducer.js` files used in Redux.

```js
// types.js
import { handler } from '@humanmade/repress';

export const posts = new handler( {
	// `type` (required): used to derive the action names, and typically should
	// match the object type (post type, taxonomy, etc).
	type: 'posts',

	// `url` (required): base URL for the type.
	url:   window.wpApiSettings.url + 'wp/v2/posts',
} );

// Register any static archives up-front.
posts.registerArchive( 'home', {} );
```

```js
// reducer.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

import { posts } from './types';

export default combineReducers( {
	// Any regular reducers you have go in here just like normal.

	// Then, create a substate for your handlers.
	posts: posts.reducer,
} );
```

In your connected components, you can use the higher-order components ([withSingle](docs/connecting.md) and [withArchive](docs/archives.md)) to pull out data from the substate easily:

```js
// Post.js
import { withSingle } from '@humanmade/repress';
import React from 'react';

import { posts } from './types';

const Post = props => <div>
	<h1>{ props.post.title.rendered }</h1>
</div>;

export default withSingle(
	// Handler object:
	posts,

	// getSubstate() - returns the substate
	state => state.posts,

	// mapPropsToId - resolve the props to the post ID
	props => props.id
)( Post );

// Then just use <Post id={ 42 } /> !
```

Alternatively, implement it with hooks (requires react-redux 7.1+):

```js
// Post.js
import { useSingle } from '@humanmade/repress';
import React from 'react';

import { posts } from './types';

const Post = props => {
	const postData = useSingle( posts, state => state.posts, props.id );

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>{ postData.post.title.rendered }</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
```
